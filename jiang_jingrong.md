# My Left Foot
*My Left Foot* is a biographical film based on the life of Christy Brown, a man born with cerebral palsy who was only able to control his left foot. Despite this challenge, he became a celebrated writer and painter. The film delicately portrays his struggles, achievements, and the support of his family.
The soundtrack, composed by Elmer Bernstein, is subtle and emotional, perfectly matching the tone of the film. Music is used not only to reflect Christy’s emotional state, but also to intensify key moments in the story. For instance, when Christy completes his first painting using only his left foot, the music gradually swells, emphasizing the sense of victory and emotional release. This demonstrates how music in the film plays a vital role in connecting the viewer to the character’s inner world.

## 소개

저는 제 장례식에서 Stray Kids의 ‘죽어보자’를 틀고 싶습니다.  
장례식이 슬픔으로만 가득 찬 자리가 아니라,  
‘나는 끝까지 미친 듯이 살다 갔다’는 메시지를 전하고 싶기 때문입니다.  
이 노래는 강렬한 리듬과 가사로, 마지막 순간까지 자신을 불태우는 듯한 느낌을 줍니다.  
저는 억눌리지 않고, 용감하게, 나답게, 때론 미쳐도 괜찮다는 인생의 태도를  
이 노래로 표현하고 싶습니다.
