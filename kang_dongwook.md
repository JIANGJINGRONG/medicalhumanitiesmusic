# Still Alice

 [This film's music]() delicately captures Alice's inner world as she gradually loses her memory and falls into confusion. The gentle piano melodies and the slowly building harmony of strings symbolize the gradual progression of the disease and the fluctuations of emotion. The music helps the audience empathize with Alice's fear and sense of loss, while also emphasizing the human dignity she strives to preserve until the end.
