# Hilary and Jackie

In the movie, Elgar's Cello Concerto is used to express Jacqueline Dupre's emotions and her struggle with illness. As her multiple sclerosis worsened, this music became a symbol of her inner struggle and loneliness. It not only showcases her talent and passion as a musician, but also reflects her deep pain and helplessness in losing her abilities and undergoing life-changing changes. The sadness and reflection in the music deepen the film's emotional depth, reinforcing themes of loss and helplessness.

Example:In Hilary and Jackie and [*A Beautiful Mind*](pyo_sujin.md), both protagonists face diseases that slowly strip away control—MS attacks the body, while schizophrenia distorts the mind. Yet both suffer from isolation, unpredictable behavior, and a deepening loss of self. The cello and mathematics become their anchors—ways to make sense of chaos. Despite different symptoms, both illnesses blur the line between who they are and what the disease makes them become.
